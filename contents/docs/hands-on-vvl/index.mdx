# Hands on VVL: The Pioneer Project

## Why This Repository?

The sails-vvl-device-details-app repository serves as the cornerstone for Redux Toolkit migration across the e-shop ecosystem. As the first project to undergo this transformation, it provides valuable insights and practical examples for other teams embarking on their migration journey.

<Note title="Pioneer Project" type="info">
  This repository, maintained by the Kilo team, serves as a reference implementation for migrating from Redux Saga to Redux Toolkit in the e-shop ecosystem. Other teams can use this as a blueprint for their own migration efforts.
