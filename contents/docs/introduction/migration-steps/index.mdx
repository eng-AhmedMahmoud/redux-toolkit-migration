# Steps of Migration

This page outlines the step-by-step process we followed to migrate our application from Redux Saga to Redux Toolkit. Each step is crucial in ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining the functionality of our app while leveraging the benefits of Redux Toolkit.

<Note title="Detailed Explanations">
  Each step mentioned here will be explained in detail in later sections, with code examples and best practices.
</Note>

## Migration Process Overview

<Step>
  <StepItem title="API Migration">
    We started by migrating our API calls, creating the Glados API and the Tradein API using Redux Toolkit's `createApi`.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Implementing the APIs">
    We replaced the old Saga-based API calls with the new Redux Toolkit APIs, utilizing `extraReducers` to handle asynchronous operations in the slice.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Saga to Listeners Transformation">
    We converted our Redux Saga effects to Redux Toolkit listeners to manage side effects.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Selector Updates">
    We updated our selectors to use the new `createAppSelector` for improved performance and memoization.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Component Structure Refactoring">
    We agreed on a new component structure, focusing on clarity, intuitiveness, and separation of concerns.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Testing">
    We implemented comprehensive testing for helpers, slices, listeners, and selectors.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Integration Testing">
    We ensured that Cypress tests were functioning without errors.
  </StepItem>
  <StepItem title="Code Review and Iteration">
    We conducted multiple rounds of code review to refine and optimize our migrated codebase.
  </StepItem>
</Step>
