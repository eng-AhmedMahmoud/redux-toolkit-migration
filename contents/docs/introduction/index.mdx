## Why Should We Read This Documentation?

Migrating from Redux Saga to Redux Toolkit is a crucial step in modernizing your React application's state management. This documentation matters because:

1. **Simplified State Management**: Redux Toolkit offers a more streamlined approach to managing application state.
2. **Improved Performance**: Redux Toolkit's built-in optimizations can lead to better app performance.
3. **Better Developer Experience**: With less boilerplate and more powerful abstractions, Redux Toolkit enhances the development process.
4. **Future-Proofing**: As the official, recommended way to write Redux logic, Redux Toolkit ensures your codebase stays up-to-date with best practices.
